# Running Arweave in a Docker Container

## Introduction

Beside running **Arweave** as a native application on a Linux, macOS, or Windows it's also
possible to operate it inside a Docker container. The system provides two scripts to
build the local container and to run the image. Blocks, data, transactions, and wallets
are saved inside Docker volumes. So in case of possibly needed image stops and removals
no data is lost.
