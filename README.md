# Arweave Server

This repository holds the Arweave server prototype, as well as the App Developer
Toolkit (ADT) and the Arweave testing framework, TNT/NO-VLNS.

Arweave is a distributed, cryptographically verified permanent archive built
on a cryptocurrency that aims to, for the first time, provide feasible data
permanence. By leveraging our novel Blockweave datastructure, data is stored
in a decentralised, peer-to-peer manner where miners are incentivised to
store rare data.

# Requirements

In order to run the Arweave server prototype and ADT, a recent (R20 and above)
version of Erlang/OTP is required as well as a version of make.

# Getting Started
To get started, simply download this repo. You can start an Arweave server
session simply by running `make session`.

You can learn more about building Arweave ADT apps by checking out our
documentation [here](ADT_README.md).

For more information on the Arweave project and to read our lightpaper visit
[arweave.org](https://www.arweave.org/).

# Ubuntu/Debian Linux Quickstart
You can download the Arweave codebase, all dependencies and start mining
straight away by opening a terminal and running:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/master/install.sh | bash && cd arweave && ./arweave-server mine peer xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx peer yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy`

Donâ€™t forget to change xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy, etc to the IP addresses you want to peer with.

# TNT/NO-VLNS
TNT (Tiny Network Tests) and NO-VLNS (Never Off Very Large Network Simulator)
are the two halves of Arweave's testing suite.

You can launch TNT by running `make tnt` and NO-VLNS by running `make no-vlns`.
